(After the shopping spree with Juliet, you meet up with Caputia.) "Hey," she greets, "How are you doing? Do you like my dialogue?" Caputia flaunts her cool text descriptions that show along with her quotes, "isn't it so cool?"
"..." | "Not impressed? That's okay. I needed you to do something anyway." Caputia asks, "Could you steal something for me?" | "..." | "Sure! Anything you say!" | "I'm not a theif" | "I don't like stealing..." | "Wait, that's illegal." | "I will take that as a yes. Come with me, there's this peanut butter I want you to take." | "Good. Come with me, there's this peanut butter I want you to take..." | "Sure. Come with me anyway, there's this peanut butter I want you to take." | "Okay. Come with me anyway, there's this peanut butter I want you to take." | "That's right," Caputia replies, "There's this peanut butter I want you to take."
"Yeah, it's pretty great. I wish Juliet had them." | "Well, Juliet will never be as good as me, heh," Caputia brags, puffing out her chest with pride. "You know, there's something I'd like to steal. Can you help me?" | "..." | "Sure! Anything you say!" | "I'm not a theif" | "I don't like stealing..." | "Wait, that's illegal." | "I will take that as a yes. Come with me, there's this peanut butter I want you to take." | "Good. Come with me, there's this peanut butter I want you to take..." | "Sure. Come with me anyway, there's this peanut butter I want you to take." | "Okay. Come with me anyway, there's this peanut butter I want you to take." | "That's right," Caputia replies, "There's this peanut butter I want you to take."
"It's nothing special." | "Oh, I see, that's a bummer then," she laments, "that's not what I wanted to talk with you about though. There's something I want to steal with you." | "..." | "Sure! Anything you say!" | "I'm not a theif" | "I don't like stealing..." | "Wait, that's illegal." | "I will take that as a yes. Come with me, there's this peanut butter I want you to take." | "Good. Come with me, there's this peanut butter I want you to take..." | "Sure. Come with me anyway, there's this peanut butter I want you to take." | "Okay. Come with me anyway, there's this peanut butter I want you to take." | "That's right," Caputia replies, "There's this peanut butter I want you to take."
"No, I prefer not to be bombarded with your huge text walls." | "Okay, I'll make sure that narrator keeps quiet then," she says, but will never be able to do, "anyways, there's something we need to do. We need to steal something." | "..." | "Sure! Anything you say!" | "I'm not a theif" | "I don't like stealing..." | "Wait, that's illegal." | "I will take that as a yes. Come with me, there's this peanut butter I want you to take." | "Good. Come with me, there's this peanut butter I want you to take..." | "Sure. Come with me anyway, there's this peanut butter I want you to take." | "Okay. Come with me anyway, there's this peanut butter I want you to take." | "That's right," Caputia replies, "There's this peanut butter I want you to take."
"It's pretty nice. The narrator's my favorite character anyways." | Aww, thank you.     "Really? You prefer the monotone voice over mine?" Caputia exhales with disapointment. "Hey, there's something I want to do with you. We need to pull off a heist" | "..." | "Sure! Anything you say!" | "I'm not a theif" | "I don't like stealing..." | "Wait, that's illegal." | "I will take that as a yes. Come with me, there's this peanut butter I want you to take." | "Good. Come with me, there's this peanut butter I want you to take..." | "Sure. Come with me anyway, there's this peanut butter I want you to take." | "Okay. Come with me anyway, there's this peanut butter I want you to take." | "That's right," Caputia replies, "There's this peanut butter I want you to take."
(After the slime falls from the sky) "This is bad." Caputia turns to you and gives you the peanut butter. "Take this and run. You need to get as far away from here as possible." Caputia grabs your hand. "Stay safe, okay? We may never see each other again..."
"..." | "I get it, it's hard, but, you need to run, got it?" Caputia stands. "If anyone in this village deserves to live, it's you." | "..." | "No, you deserve to live as well." | "Humph." | "I don't think anyone deserves life anymore than another." | "Technically, you're not alive." | "Goodbye."| "I wish I were as sure as you about that." Caputia turns away. "Goodbye." | "I hope you can understand." Caputia stands. "Goodbye." | "Well, you do." Caputia stands. "Goodbye." | "Maybe," Caputia answers, "But you are alive. I just know it." She stands, and says, "Goodbye."
"What? What do you mean? Where are you going?" | "All I can tell you is that I might not make it, got it?" Caputia takes your hand, and tells you, "I don't know why, but you seem different. It's as if you're the only person who's real, you know?" She lets go. "That's why I want you to find safety. Go." | "..." | "I think you're pretty real too." | "Humph." | "Nothing is real. Life is a simulation." | "Well, you are in a computer..." | "Goodbye." | "I wish I were as sure as you." Caputia turns her back to you. "Goodbye." | "Goodbye." | "You don't need to act so sullen," Caputia comforts, "goodbye." | "I don't know what you're talking about, but I hope you can understand." Caputia turns her back to you. "Goodbye."
"Good riddance." | "I can't tell you how much that hurts." Caputia holds her hand to her chest. "I just want you to find safety. You're the only one here that I want to survive." | "..." | "I want you to survive too." | "Humph." | "What about Juliet?" | "Don't worry, it's just the tutorial. I'll survive." | Caputia lets your hand down. "Goodbye." | Caputia keeps a firm hold on your hand before she lets go. "Goodbye." | "I'm sorry." Caputia lets go of your hand. "Goodbye." | "Juliet, and every person in this entire world never seemed real to me," Caputia says with a scowl, "in this entire world, only you are real to me." | "A what?" Caputia questions, "I know we'll never see each other again, but please don't drive yourself mad..."
"But..." | "Don't argue. We don't have time for that," Caputia orders, "You need to get somwhere safe, and fast." | "..." | "I don't want to leave you." | "Okay, bye." | "You suck." | "Actually, we have a lot of time, since conversations pause everything else around us." | "Goodbye." | "I wish you didn't have to." Caputia stands. "Goodbye." | "...Yes, bye." | "...I'm sorry." Caputia turns her back to you. "Goodbye." | "What?" Caputia turns around and looks around. The world is still in chaos, but nothing seems to actually be coming for you. "How in the world...so then, if we keep talking, maybe I can stay alive!" Caputia grabs you. "This is perfect!" she shouts, "We can---" she's gone. Conversation over.
"Actually, we will, because you're a part of the main cast" | "I'm happy you think I"m important, but I'm serious when I say what I say." Caputia stands. "I want you to survive, so you need to run." | "..." | "I'm serious too, I believe you will survive. You're important." | "Tch, you'll see. Just wait until the next major arc in the story. We'll meet again." | "Of course you wouldn't believe me..." | "I guess if you're so insistant...the programmers probably want this outcome no matter what, because they're out of time to make a truly open world game..." | "Goodbye." | "...Goodbye." | "Goodbye." | "I'm sorry," she apologizes, "Goodbye." | How did you know!? Caputia responds with, "I don't understand what you're talking about..." Caputia turns away. "Goodbye."
